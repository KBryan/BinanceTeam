##### This folder consists on the solutions of the tasks given in the week 4. 
###### Mapping, structure, and modifier have been used in these contracts. You can copy these codes and compile using [BSCIDE](https://bscide.com/project/welcome), and deploy it on BSC. This all material is provided for the practice purpose. The other reading material regarding these smart contracts and solidity grammar can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/120QjDd5UGNb9IYZ0iSC3MjXDkq4ajy78kER3PTGnlWY/edit?usp=sharing).
