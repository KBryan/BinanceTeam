# Week5
**This week is about how to create an ERC20/BEP20 token and use it to create a farming system.**

After you deployed the ERC20/BEP20 token, you should write it down. When you create the farming contract, you should paste them to the corresponding parameters.

You can learn these codes and make some improvements on top of it.

Follow the steps by this:

1.Deploy the Dai / Dapp token.  
2.Deploy the TokenFarm contract.  
3.Transfer some Dapp token to TokenFarm contract address.  
4.Approve your Dai token to TokenFarm address.  
5.Stake your Dai token to TokenFarm contract.  
6.Issus the Dapptoken.  
7.Unstake the Dai token.
