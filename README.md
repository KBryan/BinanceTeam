This is a initial repo for the Binance Team Challenge

# Team Challenge Concept 1

Building a Decentralized Trading Exchange on the Binance Smart Chain, explores decentralized exchanges, which aim to bring more transparency to the trading of assets and commodities. They eliminate the middleman and can thus ensure faster settlements. 

They also help control fraudulent practices such as price manipulation. This project looks at creating a price-time priority matching engine using Solidity smart contracts. This matching engine can then operate on a decentralized orderbook that can accept orders from all the participants on the network.

# Team Challenge Concept 2

Seeing that the Binance Chain is NEW. Why are we still using Solidity if we have an Alternative. 

Create a dApp using Reach Lang. It using a simple dApp programming model and compiles not only to Ethereum but also Algorand Blockchains.
